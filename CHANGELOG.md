Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/)
and semantic versioning.

## [0.65.1] - 2026-09-06

### Changed

## [0.65.0] - 2026-06-27

### Added
- Email CRM contacts: when SMTP is configured (Settings → Email), an opportunity with a client contact email and a lead with an email address each show a **Send email** card on their detail page — compose a subject and message and send it via the configured SMTP server. Opportunity emails are logged on the **activity timeline**; both are recorded in the audit log. Bilingual EN/FR.

## [0.64.0] - 2026-06-27

### Added
- Opportunity activity timeline: each CRM opportunity now has an **Activity** section on its detail page where you can post free-text **notes** and see an automatic, chronological history of key events — created, details updated, stage changed (with the new stage) and outcome changed (won/lost/reopened) — each attributed to a user and timestamped. Bilingual EN/FR.

## [0.63.0] - 2026-06-27

### Added
- ITSM Problem Management module (toggle in Settings → Problems): track problems (PRB-####) behind recurring incidents with configurable type and status, priority (low→critical), impact, root cause, workaround, a known-error flag and resolution (which marks the problem resolved). List with KPIs (open, known errors, resolved) and filters. Gated by `problems.read` / `problems.manage` permissions.
- ITSM Release Management module (toggle in Settings → Releases): plan and track releases (REL-####) with a version, configurable type and status, owner, client, planned and actual release dates, release notes and a rollback plan.

### Added
- CRM analytics view (new **Analytics** tab): **win rate** (won vs lost), **average deal size**, **average sales cycle** (days from creation to close on won deals) and **won revenue** KPIs, plus an **open pipeline by stage** distribution chart showing deal count and value per stage. Bilingual EN/FR.

## [0.61.0] - 2026-06-27

### Added
- CRM on the dashboard: when the CRM module is enabled, the dashboard now shows a **Pipeline value** KPI card and an **Opportunities closing soon** panel in the "Attention needed" section — listing open deals due within 14 days (or already overdue, shown in red), linking straight to each opportunity. Bilingual EN/FR.

## [0.60.0] - 2026-06-27

### Added
- CRM expected-close aging: open opportunities past their expected close date are now flagged as **overdue** — a red badge on pipeline board cards, a red date in the list view, and an overdue count shown under the Open deals KPI. Helps surface stalled deals that need attention. Bilingual EN/FR.

## [0.59.0] - 2026-06-27

### Added
- CRM pipeline board now has **inline Won / Lost actions** on each opportunity card — mark a deal won or lost (or reopen it) in one click without leaving the board, with optimistic UI and an audit-log entry.

## [0.58.0] - 2026-06-27

### Added
- CRM pipeline board: the CRM → Pipeline tab now offers a **drag-and-drop Kanban board** grouping opportunities into columns by stage (plus an Unassigned column), with per-column deal counts and total value. Drag a card to move the opportunity to another stage (recorded in the audit log). A **Board / List** toggle switches between the board and the existing table while preserving active filters. Bilingual EN/FR.

## [0.57.0] - 2026-06-27

### Added
- CRM / sales pipeline module (toggle in Settings → CRM): manage **leads** (LEAD-####) with source, status, owner, contact details and estimated value, and **opportunities** (OPP-####) through a configurable pipeline with stages, monetary value, win probability, owner, expected close date and won/lost outcome. One-click **convert a qualified lead into a client** (carrying over company and contact details). Tabbed CRM view (Pipeline / Leads) with KPIs (open deals, pipeline value, won deals, active leads) and filters. Pipeline stages, lead sources and lead statuses are managed in Settings → Taxonomies.

Generate a per-device token and deploy the provided PowerShell (Windows) or bash (Linux/macOS) agent on the workstation; it reports metrics to a token-authenticated API endpoint.

## [0.53.0] - 2026-06-27

### Added
- Audit log (Settings → Audit log): a chronological record of who did what and when across the app, with entity/action filters and search. The framework records actions best-effort and currently covers clients, devices, subscriptions, contracts, knowledge articles, ticket create/status/assignment and user suspension; more actions are being instrumented over time. Gated by a new "View audit log" permission.

## [0.52.0] - 2026-06-27

### Added
- ITSM ticket types: classify tickets as Incident, Service request, Change (configurable in Settings → Taxonomies → Ticket types). The type shows on the ticket list and detail, can be filtered, and is set on creation or inline on the ticket.

## [0.51.0] - 2026-06-27

## [0.48.0] - 2026-06-27

### Changed
- Rewrote the README with a feature-by-feature overview and product screenshots.

## [0.46.0] - 2026-06-27

### Added
- Starter roles seeded out of the box: Manager (runs operations and the team, no system configuration) and Technician (day-to-day operations, no access to settings) — alongside the full-access Admin.
- User menu in the top bar: click your avatar to switch language and light/dark theme, open security settings, or sign out.

### Changed

## [0.45.0] - 2026-06-27

### Changed
- Planning is now a full month calendar (previous/next month, Today, localized month and weekday names) with colored event chips per visit type, today highlighted, and a "+N more" overflow — replacing the week strip.
- Refreshed the Clients list: each row shows a colored initials avatar with company name and domain, a status pill, and view/edit action icons, with row hover.

## [0.44.0] - 2026-06-26

### Added
- New Subscriptions module (toggle in Settings → Subscriptions) to manage recurring subscriptions, renewals, warranties and support plans per client: type & status (configurable in Settings → Taxonomies), provider, cost & billing cycle, seats, start/renewal/coverage dates, auto-renew and support level.

## [0.43.0] - 2026-06-26

### Added
- Bilingual interface (English / French), chosen per user in Settings → Language and remembered on your account. Admins set the default language for new users and the client portal. Client-portal users can switch language from the portal header. This release translates the navigation, top bar, dashboard, sign-in, settings, and the client portal; the remaining module pages are being translated next.

## [0.42.0] - 2026-06-26

### Added
- Light / dark theme toggle in the top bar. Your choice is remembered, and the page loads in the right theme with no flash.

### Changed
- Redesigned the Settings → Taxonomies and Contract types editors: each entry is now a clean single-row table (color, name, order, active, save, delete) with column headers, instead of a tall stacked form per item.

## [0.41.0] - 2026-06-26

### Changed
- Redesigned the ticket detail page for a cleaner, less cluttered right column: editable fields (status, priority, assignee, due date, device, tags) now save instantly on change instead of each having its own form and "Update" button, the duplicated read-only/edit fields were merged, and the activity timeline moved to the main column where it reads at full width.

## [0.40.0] - 2026-06-26

### Added
- Import clients from a CSV file (Clients → Import CSV). Recognizes Company (required), Domain and Status columns; validates each row, imports the valid ones, and reports any skipped rows with the reason.

## [0.39.0] - 2026-06-26

### Added
- CSV export extended to the Tickets list and (for managers) the Timesheets list. Timesheets export requires the "view all" permission and the Timesheeting module enabled.

## [0.38.0] - 2026-06-26

### Added
- Export to CSV from the Clients, Devices, and Contracts lists (Excel-friendly UTF-8). Each export respects module-enabled state and your permissions.

## [0.37.0] - 2026-06-26

### Added
- Dashboard "Attention needed" section surfaces contracts ending within 30 days and device warranties expiring within 60 days, each linking to the record. Shown per module enabled + permission.

## [0.36.0] - 2026-06-26

### Added
- Knowledge base in the client portal: staff can flag a published article "Visible in client portal", and clients can then browse and read those articles (with search) from a new Knowledge base tab in their portal. Drafts and unflagged articles are never exposed.

## [0.35.0] - 2026-06-26

### Added
- The Clients list now shows monthly recurring revenue (MRR) and device count per client, plus a total-MRR KPI. Columns appear only when the Contracts / Devices modules are enabled and you have permission to see them.

## [0.34.0] - 2026-06-26

### Added
- Admins can require two-factor authentication for all users (Settings → Security → Organization policy). When on, anyone without 2FA is sent to a setup screen before they can use the app; backup codes ensure no one is locked out.

## [0.33.0] - 2026-06-26

### Added
- Contract ↔ timesheets linkage: a contract with an included-hours quota now shows a "Time usage" card on its page — logged time for the client this billing period vs the included hours, with a progress bar (green / amber near limit / red over).

## [0.32.0] - 2026-06-26

### Added
- Clients list now shows KPIs (total, active, unassigned, open tickets) and a per-client open-ticket count column.
- "New ticket for this device" on the device page pre-fills the client and links the device on the new ticket.

### Changed
- Premium client detail header: initials avatar, status, and quick stats (open tickets, projects, devices, contacts).

## [0.31.0] - 2026-06-26

### Added
- Module linkage: a ticket can be linked to a device (the asset it concerns), chosen from the ticket's client devices on the ticket detail; the device page lists its related tickets.
- The dashboard now shows an "Across your modules" KPI row (projects, visits this week, monthly recurring contract value, devices, knowledge articles) — each card appears only for enabled modules the user can access.

### Changed
- Premium navigation: the sidebar now has icons and a refined active state.

## [0.30.0] - 2026-06-26

### Added
- Device / asset management module (toggle on/off in Settings → Devices): track managed devices (laptops, servers, network gear, printers…) with configurable type and status, serial number, manufacturer/model, hostname, purchase and warranty dates, and client assignment. List with KPIs (total, assigned, unassigned, warranty expiring within 60 days), filters, a devices section on the client detail, and warranty highlighting. RBAC-gated by `devices.*` permissions.

## [0.29.0] - 2026-06-26

### Added
- Knowledge base module: write and maintain internal articles (how-tos, troubleshooting, tips & tricks, policies) with Markdown content, configurable categories (Settings → Taxonomies), draft/published status, and full-text search. Drafts are visible to editors only. RBAC-gated by `knowledge.*` permissions.

## [0.28.0] - 2026-06-26

### Added
- Two-factor authentication now issues 10 one-time backup codes when you enable it (shown once, stored hashed). At sign-in you can enter a backup code instead of an authenticator code if you lose your device, and each is consumed on use. Backup codes can be regenerated from Settings → Security with a current code.

## [0.27.0] - 2026-06-26

### Added
- Optional two-factor authentication (TOTP): users enable an authenticator app from Settings → Security (scan a QR, verify a code). When enabled, sign-in asks for a 6-digit code as a second step. Secrets are encrypted at rest; disabling requires a current code.

## [0.26.0] - 2026-06-26

### Added
- Invitation lifecycle management on Settings → Users: pending invitations show as "Invite expired" once past their expiry, and can be **resent** (fresh link, old one revoked) or **revoked** (cancels the pending invite and removes the placeholder account). Resending/revoking writes the proper REVOKED status.

## [0.25.0] - 2026-06-26

### Added
- Per-contact client portal permissions: each contact can be allowed (or not) to create tickets and to reply on tickets, set from the contact form. Viewing their company's tickets remains the baseline. The portal hides and enforces these capabilities accordingly.

## [0.24.0] - 2026-06-26

### Added
- Dashboard now opens with a "My work" section for the signed-in user: their open tickets, upcoming tasks, and upcoming visits.

### Changed
- Contract types are now managed as a tab in Settings → Taxonomies (consistent with the other taxonomies).
- Time entries can be edited directly from the time-tracking panel on tickets/tasks/visits (and editing returns you to where you started).
- The time-tracking panel on the ticket detail sits in the right column above the ticket properties (no longer full-width).

## [0.23.0] - 2026-06-26

### Added
- Client portal: a separate, external-facing area where client contacts sign in (own session) to view their company's tickets, open new tickets, and reply on the conversation. Staff grant or revoke portal access per contact from the client detail (an email link lets the contact set their password). Portal sessions are isolated from staff sessions, and a portal user can only ever see their own client's data.

## [0.22.0] - 2026-06-26

### Changed
- Refreshed KPI cards across the dashboard, tickets, projects, contracts, and timesheets with a cleaner, consistent `StatCard` design (colored accent, soft glow, tabular figures, hover state).

## [0.21.0] - 2026-06-26

### Added
- Configurable ticket tags (managed in Settings → Taxonomies): tag tickets on creation or from the detail, see colored tag chips in the list and detail, and filter the ticket list by tag.

## [0.20.0] - 2026-06-26

### Added
- The monthly client timesheet report can now be **downloaded as a server-generated PDF** (`pdf-lib`) and **emailed as a PDF attachment** to a recipient (defaulting to the client's contact email) when SMTP is configured. The browser "Print" option remains available.

## [0.19.0] - 2026-06-26

### Added
- Quick-assign a technician directly from the project Kanban task cards and from the planning week calendar visit cards, gated by the `projects.assign` / `visits.assign` permissions.

## [0.18.0] - 2026-06-26

### Added
- Self-service **password reset**: a "Forgot password?" link on sign-in leads to a request form that emails a time-limited (1 hour) reset link; the reset page sets a new password. Tokens are single-use and sha256-hashed at rest, the request form never reveals whether an email exists, and outstanding tokens are invalidated on use. When SMTP is not configured, the reset link is logged to the server console (dev fallback). Honors `APP_URL` for the link host.

## [0.17.0] - 2026-06-26

### Added
- Tickets now have a **due date**, set on creation or from the ticket detail. Overdue open tickets are flagged with a badge, shown in red in the list, and counted in a new "Overdue" KPI.
- **Email notifications** for ticket events (assigned, new comment, status change) sent to the assignee and creator (excluding the actor) when SMTP is configured. Set `APP_URL` so the email links resolve to your deployment (defaults to `http://localhost:3000`).

## [0.16.0] - 2026-06-26

### Added
- Project Kanban board now supports drag-to-reorder tasks within a column (and still across columns), with the order persisted.
- A task can be deleted from its edit page.

## [0.15.0] - 2026-06-26

### Added
- Project detail now offers four task views: **List**, **Board**, **Timeline** (Gantt-style bars across the project's date range, colored by status), and **Calendar** (month grid with tasks on their due dates, navigable by month).

## [0.14.0] - 2026-06-26

### Added
- Contracts module (toggle on/off in Settings → Contracts): client contracts with a type, a configurable status, value, billing cycle (monthly/quarterly/yearly/one-off), and an included-hours quota per period.
- Configurable **contract types** with a default hourly rate (Support, Maintenance, Infogérance, …), managed in Settings → Contract types; **contract statuses** managed as a taxonomy.
- Contracts list with KPIs (count, monthly recurring value, total value, expiring within 30 days), filters, and a Contracts section on the client detail.
- New RBAC permissions: `contracts.read`, `contracts.manage`.
- Hourly rates now live on contract types: new time entries inherit the rate from the client's active contract, falling back to a global default rate set in Settings → Timesheets.
- Monthly per-client timesheet report (Timesheets → Reports) with hours and billable amounts, exportable as PDF via the browser (Save as PDF).

### Changed
- Timesheeting settings moved to their own Settings → Timesheets page (was under General).
